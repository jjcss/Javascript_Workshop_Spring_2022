# Web Development Basics Workshop
Thank you all for joining us for our Web Development Workshop on April, 12, 2022. For anyone who missed the meeting, we talked about the basics of HTML/CSS and Javascript whilst doing a coding demo, creating a guessing game. This game consisted of a user guessing a number from 1 - 100. Below are additional details on using the folders "Starter Code" and "Full Code" to see some of the code that we went over and wrote. 

We hope that you all learned a few valuable skills Below you will find the Zoom recording, and for additional resources on web development, checkout out our presentation slides. Below is information on our next workshop, too.

### Starter and Full Code Folders
#### Starter Code
This folder contains all the starter code that we sent out to all members during the meeting. Inside the folder you'll see the completed HTML and CSS code for the guessing game, but the Javascript File only contains some comments, no code. 

#### Full Code
This folder contains the completed HTML/CSS and Javascript code, that is needed to complete the guessing game that we did in today's session. Feel free to download the code and practice/review the code that we wrote.
